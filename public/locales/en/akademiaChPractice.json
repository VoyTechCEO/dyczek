      "desc": "There are many causes of disease, however, this is the most significant cause of disease aetiology. The nervous system coordinates cellular activity for its environmental adaptation. Factors and conditions that affect the nervous system, to which the body is unable to adapt, cause changes in the pattern of transmission of nerve impulses that deviate from the norm. As a result, many functional disorders of the nervous system can lead to disease."

      "desc": "Disorders in the balance of the segments of the spine, pelvis and cranial bones in humans are often encountered in clinical practice. Prolonged, unnatural involvement of the nervous system can result from disorders, strains and stresses of the motor system caused by a personâ€™s desire for upright posture. Mechanical damage or subluxations of spinal segments are often caused by asymmetrical gravitational load on the motor system and the appearance of developmental defects, or irritations: mechanical, thermal and psychological to the nervous system."

      "desc": "Disorders in the balance of the segments of the spine, pelvis and cranial bones can be related to common human ailments of organic, visceral and vasomotor origin. When the relevant circumstances arise, almost any element of the nervous system can directly or indirectly cause reactions in other elements of the nervous system. Together, independent causes of bodily malfunction can have a more debilitating effect than individual ones. Disturbances in the natural balance of the spinal, pelvic and cranial segments can initiate, or exacerbate, neurovascular and neuraxial stability disorders. Therefore, correction of musculoskeletal imbalances is absolutely necessary for effective management of the patient."
