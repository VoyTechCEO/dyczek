      "question": "I pay attention to what I eat and the sources of my food. Is this enough to ensure good health?",
      "answer": "<p>According to Dr. Rath, a pioneer of Cellular Medicine, “we should not be fooled by self-proclaimed diet apostles and yoga masters” (Rath, 2007:247). The source of human health is ensuring that every cell has sufficient nutrients, i.e. macronutrients (proteins, carbohydrates and fats) and micronutrients (vitamins, minerals, trace elements and amino acids) (Rath, 2007).</p><p><b>Health and illness are determined at the level of the millions of cells making up our body and organs (Rath, 2007:225)</b></p>"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is Cellular Medicine?",
      "answer": "<p>Cellular Medicine is a science which analyses the nutritional needs of the cell and points out the need to supplement modern food with micronutrients, as they are lacking. The source of life is the energy (ATP) produced by the cell. A malnourished cell produces too little energy for life. How often is complaining about the lack of energy the first symptom of disease. This is a signal that your cells are malnourished.</p><p><b>Little life energy = the beginning of disease</b></p>"
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you explain that the people of the past did not ingest micronutrients and still had good health?",
      "answer": "<p>In the past, food had more micronutrients.  Since the 1960s, large-scale food production, meaning producing as quickly and as much as possible while using the smallest plot of land possible, means that modern food has only a small percentage of nutritional value compared to what it once had. Moreover, it’s contaminated with artificial fertilizers and pesticides.</p>"
    },
    {
      "question": "All the fruit and vegetables I consume I also produce myself. I don’t use artificial fertilizers or chemical pesticides. Are they therefore also deficient?",
      "answer": "<p>A plant needs water in order to grow. Usually, this water is rainwater. As it turns out, water is a carrier of information about the environment it grows in. “You could say that water, like a magnetic tape, records the magnetic resonance of other substances, takes them for itself – you could say it imitates them and passes them as its own. This can be explained that water retains the information of contaminated substances in its molecular structure, so that their properties are still visible, even if the water has changed its form.” (Higa, 2003:138). Traditionally, evaporating water was purified by the sun’s rays in the higher layers of the atmosphere. Nowadays, the higher layers of the atmosphere are so polluted, that the purified water vapor, or water, is contaminated before it falls to the ground in the form of rain. The problem of water pollution is very serious. The consequence is widespread poisoning of soils by rainwater to a lesser or greater extent. Soil poisoning reduces the nutritional value of the plants growing on it. Table 1 shows the contents of several essential micronutrients needed for the health of cells, i.e. the production of the life energy, in 1985 and 2002. The data from 2992 compared to 1985 is already alarming. Since then, the content of micronutrients has most likely decreased even more, as the agricultural chemisation has rather increased. Perhaps here we should look for an increase in cancer, allergies, etc.</p><p><b>Mineral compounds and vitamins, content in milligrams per 100g of product</b></p><table><tr><th>Product</th><th>Ingredient</th><th>1985</th><th>2002</th><th>Difference</th></tr><tr><th colSpan='5'>Fruits</th></tr><tr><td>Apples</td><td>Vitamine C</td><td>5</td><td>2</td><td>-60%</td></tr><tr><td rowSpan='4'>Bananas</td><td>Calcium</td><td>8</td><td>7</td><td>-12%</td></tr><tr><td>Folic Acid</td><td>23</td><td>5</td><td>-79%</td></tr><tr><td>Magnesium</td><td>31</td><td>24</td><td>-23%</td></tr><tr><td>Vitamine B6</td><td>330</td><td>18</td><td>-95%</td></tr><tr><td rowSpan='2'>Strawberries</td><td>Calcium</td><td>21</td><td>12</td><td>-43%</td></tr><tr><td>Vitamine C</td><td>60</td><td>18</td><td>-87%</td></tr><tr><th colSpan='5'>Vegetables</th></tr><tr><td rowSpan='3'>Broccoli</td><td>Calcium</td><td>103</td><td>28</td><td>-73%</td></tr><tr><td>Folic Acid</td><td>47</td><td>18</td><td>-62%</td></tr><tr><td>Magnesium</td><td>24</td><td>11</td><td>-55%</td></tr><tr><td rowSpan='4'>Beans</td><td>Calcium</td><td>56</td><td>22</td><td>-51%</td></tr><tr><td>Folic Acid</td><td>39</td><td>30</td><td>-23%</td></tr><tr><td>Magnesium</td><td>26</td><td>18</td><td>-31%</td></tr><tr><td>Vitamine B6</td><td>140</td><td>32</td><td>-77%</td></tr><tr><td rowSpan='2'>Potatoes</td><td>Calcium</td><td>14</td><td>3</td><td>-78%</td></tr><tr><td>Magnesium</td><td>27</td><td>14</td><td>-48%</td></tr><tr><td rowSpan='2'>Carrots</td><td>Calcium</td><td>37</td><td>28</td><td>-24%</td></tr><tr><td>Magnesium</td><td>21</td><td>6</td><td>-75%</td></tr><tr><td rowSpan='2'>Spinach</td><td>Magnesium</td><td>62</td><td>15</td><td>-76%</td></tr><tr><td>Vitamine C</td><td>61</td><td>18</td><td>-65%</td></tr></table><h5>Table 1. Fruit and vegetables of yesterday and today</h5><h5>Source: 1985 Geigy (Switzerland) 1996 and 2002 Szwarcwald Oberthal sanatorium</h5><p>Do you think, in light of this information, that our diet will fully meet our bodies’ needs for micronutrients (vitamins and minerals)? The answer to this question immediately comes to mind. Therefore, we already need to take care of the micronutrients we supply to our body. And it’s not just about the mere supple of vitamins and minerals, but also about their quality and amount.</p>"

      "question": "What might be the first symptoms of micronutrient deficiency in our food?",
      "answer": "<p>Usually, the first symptom of micronutrient deficiency in our food is a lack of life energy and worsened mood. Micronutrients are necessary for the production of energy (ATP) in the cell. This energy is the energy of life. These are followed by symptoms of diseases generated by the stress of the environment in which we live in, as well as other ailments related to genetic conditions.</p>"

    {
      "question": "Why don’t governments make sure that the food produced is healthy?",
      "answer": "<p>Answering this question is very difficult, but a couple hypotheses can be stated:</p><ul><li>Perhaps there exist corporations that have their interest in increasing the number of sick people who need to be kept alive, which grants them money. The costs of treatments are paid for by the taxpayers both from their taxes and their savings. Politicians may be sponsored by the corporations in question, so it’s not in their personal interest to take care of the nation they govern.</li><li>Maybe someone cares about reducing the human population, as there has been a lot of talk lately about overpopulation and its impact on ecology.</li></ul>"
    },
    {
      "question": "So, is it possible to live without ingesting micronutrients?",
      "answer": "<p>Certainly yes! However, it is possible to be more creative, productive and keep the vigour of life longer if you provide the body with the necessary micronutrients for optimal life energy production.</p>"
    },
    {
      "question": "What kind of lifestyle necessitates the introduction of additional micronutrients into the diet?",
      "answer": "<p>Haste, availability and ringing phones all cause stress, which increases the demand for micronutrients. Their absence in our food causes burnout, which is very difficult and lengthy to treat. Unfortunately, it often ends in a heart attack, cancer, mental breakdown or multiple sclerosis. The human body can be compared to an engine. The better fuel, that is, food for the cell we provide, the longer it will run without breaking down, i.e. disease.</p><p><b>The greater the stress, that is, the strain on the human body, the greater the need for energy, i.e. micronutrients required for its production.</b></p>"
    },
    {
      "question": "At what age should you start supplementing you diet with micronutrients?",
      "answer": "<p>It may sound biased, but supplementing food with additional micronutrients is best started before planning to have children, both for men and women. One in three newborns is born with allergies. Neonatal scoliosis is becoming more common! It can be assumed that the lack of micronutrients in the mother’s diet will have a negative impact on the child’s proper development in the womb. It is in no one’s interest to have their child be born like the one pictured above (Fig. 1).

      "question": "From what sources should one purchase micronutrients / supplements?",
      "answer": "<p>A good source micronutrients / supplements supply is one you use personally for at least 1.5 years and notice positive changes in many aspects of your health and do not intend to resign from it.</p><p>What is essential to pay attention to while choosing micronutrients / supplements:</p><ul><li>Micronutrients must be of organic and not synthetic origin. Synthetic micronutrients are recognised by the human body as a foreign body and must be managed, often forming toxic compounds. In addition, the absorption rate of synthetic micronutrients varies only between 3% to 10%, according to various sources.</li><li>A micronutrient manufacturer should follow the strictest quality procedures, the so-called 6S (Selection, Sourcing, Structure, Standarization, Safety, Substantiation), meaning (1) using selection in the choosing of bioactive ingredients, (2) the material should be of the highest quality, (3) the molecular structure containing micronutrients should be structured in such a way to ensure its full absorption by the body, (4) the product should contain standardised, genuine content of bioactive micronutrients, (5) the manufacturer should furthermore check the materials from a reputable source for toxic components, commonly found in air, water and soil, (6) a scientific basis is also necessary to confirm the clinical effectiveness of micronutrients used by the manufacturer.</li><li>Having your own plantations to produce natural micronutrients is a good practice. However, this does not ensure that the product will be free of toxic compounds commonly present in the air, and therefore in the rain and the groundwater, which is essential for the plant growth. It therefore seems necessary to test all components with a mass spectrometer, capable of detecting one particle on an unwanted component, such as a toxin in 53 billion molecules. This can be compared to finding a drop of ink in 3,375,000 (three million three hundred and seventy-five thousand) litres of water. In comparison, such an amount of water fits in an Olympic swimming pool.</li></ul>"

    {
      "question": "What is a supplement?",
      "answer": "<p>A supplement is a generally available foodstuff, often referred to as a specialised form of food, intended to add to the daily diet. It contains micronutrients (vitamins, minerals, trace elements and amino acids), fatty acids and flavonoids.</p>"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is the purity of the supplements so important?",
      "answer": "<p>Imagine swallowing 4 pills, containing toxic compounds, daily for 10 years. It’s not difficult to count how many toxins and contaminants you can consume in that time. The calculation is simple!</p>"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why should you choose supplement manufacturers with caution?",
      "answer": "<p>Some supplement manufacturers states that it contains, let’s say, 500 mg of vitamin C extracted from a natural source, but only 10% is the bioactive form of vitamin C, that is, the form which can be absorbed by the body. In addition, the name of a supplement ingredient does not always ensure that its molecular structure is of the highest quality.</p><p>The need for supplementation, that is supplementing the food we consume with micronutrients, is increasingly recognised by even the most conservative representatives of natural pro-health prevention. Supplementation is beginning to be a powerful industry, with crooked manufacturers appearing, living at the cost of the customers’ ignorance.</p>"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is it possible to treat diseases with supplements / micronutrients?",
      "answer": "<p>Yes, you can, but it takes several months. HOWEVER, YOU SHOULD CONSULT YOUR CONDITION WITH YOUR HEALTH CARE PROVIDER, WHO IS ABLE TO MONITOR BOTH THE IMPROVEMENT AND DETERIORATION OF YOUR HEALTH.</p><p>Regular consumption of micronutrients can restore the proper functioning of all cells, cleanse, nourish and regenerate the body, therefore restoring the health and vigour to life. It turns out that often supplementing food with micronutrients during drug treatment, prescribed by a conventional medicine doctor, results in better effects of the medicine. Thus, the period of the drug treatment is shortened.</p>"
    },
    {
      "question": "What can I expect when I start supplementing my food with micronutrients? ",
      "answer": "<p>With surprise, you may not even notice that the everyday journey you make no longer tires you so much, you don’t need an afternoon nap. You go up to the fourth floor, run up to the bus and do it without running out of breath. Surprisingly, you haven’t caught any flu and it’s already spring, and the cold, if you caught it, disappeared quickly and without any complications (cough, hoarseness, etc.). In the summer you notice that spring allergies somehow eluded you this year. The hairdresser notices that your hair has become thicker and shinier, while the hand cream lies useless. You notice how beautiful the world is. You smile more often to yourself and others, and you become more tolerant and understanding.</p>"
